<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>

<p><strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked to provide Appigo with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate and/or pay for any fees related to the Service. Appigo may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to a purchase to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Method</strong></p>
<p>Appigo will charge the subscription fees and any other additional fees you authorize to the charge or credit card account provided by you. By authorizing Appigo to charge a credit card for the fees associated with your subscription, you are authorizing Appigo to automatically continue charging that card (or any replacement card if the original card is renewed, lost, stolen, or changed for any reason by the card issuer, and the issuer informs Appigo of the new replacement card account) for all fees or charges associated with your subscription including any renewal fees as described below. You authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and authorize Appigo, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Appigo, to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card account until such amounts are paid in full. You agree to provide Appigo updated information on your credit card upon Appigo’s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid. If payment is not received by Appigo from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Appigo.</p>
<p><strong>Free Trial Period</strong></p>
<p>Appigo may offer you a one-time free trial period during which you can try out the Service for free ("Free Trial Period"). During the Free Trial Period, you agree that Appigo will have the right (subject to applicable local law) to send you communications, notices and news about the Service to your Todo Cloud email address and to any alternate email address you may have provided. Local law may allow you to revoke your consent to receiving these communications at any time during the Free Trial Period. Only premium renewal accounts in good standing are eligible to receive upgrades and are therefore not available to subscribers during the Free Trial Period. Appigo reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit this Free Trial Period offer at any time. Your license to the Software during the Free Trial Period will automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration or cancellation of the Free Trial Period, (ii) when the Service is no longer made available, (iii) when Appigo cancels your Free Trial Period, or (iv) when your computer or mobile device has not accessed the Services for more than fifteen (15) calendar days.
